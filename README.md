# Sprint-4
Project for Sprint 4

Description: This project is for the purpose of practice in using streamlit and plotly via the render platform to do analysis and visualization for a vehicle advertisements dataset. There will be scrollable dataframes which were used during the project, and several distributions oriented around price, vehicle condition and brand available as well. A selectbox is used for one histogram to compare one brand to another and checkbox to adjust another histogram's x-axis.

**Checkbox in question adjusts histogram's x-axis: displaying vehicle age 3 to 10 when toggled. It is toggled by default.**
